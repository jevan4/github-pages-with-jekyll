Hello! Today, I went outside to get some fresh air. That's always something good to do before going on a screen all day! 

I'm working on a new piano song, "Love's Sorrow." Even though at first it looked to difficult for my level, I seem to be able to play a part of it under tempo. 

I'm going to receive more instructions on how to code so I can write even more on this page!
